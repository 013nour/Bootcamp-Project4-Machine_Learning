# Bootcamp-Project4-Machine_Learning

Based on what youâ€™ve learned until now, use NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to create a project of your choosing. 

This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements:

- Choose a public dataset that needs to clean and preprocess.
- EDA
    - Apply the essential EDA steps: head, shape, info, describe, and missing values
    - Display different charts that give an overview of your data.
- Use three splitting methods (train-test split, cross-validation split and GridSearchCV).
- Choose five proper ML Algorithms.
- Report appropriate evaluation metrics for each model.
- Create a chart that compares the final results of your selected models.
- Write a final conclusion and recommendations (your interpretation of the results).
- Report your final conclusion and findings in one page (readme markdown file).
    - Team members.
    - Introduction (problem or your goal).
    - Dataset Overview and Source.
    - A table represents the final results of ML models.
- [Nice to have - Optional] Create an interactive dashboard.

- Due Date: Sun, 26 Nov, at 3:00 p.m.
- The Final presentation will be on Sunday (10 min for each group).
Final Deliverables:
- Notebook file(.ipynb).
- Dataset file.
- README.md file.
